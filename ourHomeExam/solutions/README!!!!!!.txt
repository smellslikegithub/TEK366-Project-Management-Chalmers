Q.1 
Stage-gate caveats

(20 points; maximum 1500 words)

The Stage-gate system (Maylor 2010 pp110) is a popular method for top management to control the organisation's development projects. Investigate which drawbacks this method may have when implemented, and suggest ways to compensate or overcome them. 

Q.2
Democratic and laissez-faire style leadership

(10 points; maximum 800 words) 

Psychologist Kurt Lewin, a firm believer in democracy, compared the leaderships styles autocratic (authoritarian), democratic and laissez-faire, to find that the democratic leadership style has many advantages. But what about laissez-faire? Write a letter to your friend the junior management consultant Mollgan, who is about to start working on an assignment at a client company. You know that Mollgan is to run a large project and is to set a standard for leadership performed in the project. Or was it? You can't quite remember what Mollgan told you. Perhaps the assignment was only to report on the expected pros and cons of different leadership styles, and the report was to be distributed for others to read, including line-managers that don't work in projects. Anyway, you promised Mollgan to investigate laissez-faire. You may suggest improvements and opportunities to pursue; i.e. you need not to only discuss 'true' laissez-faire, if there is such a thing.


Q.3
Agile in the Pentagon
(10 points; maximum 800 words) 

What if the Pentagon had organized its Bradely development project, described in The Pentagon Wars movie, according to agile (Maylor 2010, pp394) from the start? Which opportunities and drawbacks would you foresee? (Please overlook that agile is a much later management innovation, and that Maylor focuses on software development)
